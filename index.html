    <h1>A brief text about Our Solar System</h1>
    The solar system is a vast and intricate arrangement of celestial bodies, all orbiting around our star, the Sun. The Sun, which accounts for 99.8% of the solar system's mass, provides the light and energy that makes life possible on Earth. Surrounding the Sun are eight planets, each following its elliptical orbit.Closest to the Sun is Mercury, a small, rocky planet scorched by its proximity to the star. Following Mercury is Venus, a planet with a toxic atmosphere and surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Earth, our home, is the third planet, uniquely positioned in the habitable zone where liquid water and life thrive. Mars, the red planet, comes next, known for its iron-rich soil and the possibility of ancient water flows. Beyond Mars lies the asteroid belt, a region filled with rocky debris and minor planets. The largest object here is Ceres, a dwarf planet. Past the asteroid belt, we encounter the gas giants. Jupiter is the largest planet, with its iconic Great Red Spot, a massive storm that has raged for centuries. Saturn is famous for its stunning rings made of ice and rock particles, visible even with small telescopes. Further out, Uranus and Neptune are ice giants. Uranus has an unusual tilt, causing it to rotate on its side, while Neptune is known for its deep blue color and violent storms. Both planets are surrounded by faint rings and multiple moons. The solar system doesnâ€™t end at Neptune, though. Beyond lies the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies including Pluto, once considered the ninth planet before being reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006. Eris, another distant dwarf planet, also resides here. Even further out is the Oort Cloud, a theoretical boundary filled with comets that may mark the outermost edge of the solar system.
